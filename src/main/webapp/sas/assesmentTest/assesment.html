        <td class="description" style="width: 556px; height: 189px;" colspan="6" rowspan="5">Windsor, England (CNN) - The masses roared, as they always do on such occasions, and under a cloudless English sky in the historic town of Windsor, there was a new beginning.

            It was a royal wedding like no other; a gospel choir sang, Dr. Martin Luther King was quoted in a rousing address and a young couple was united in a marriage that will change a venerable institution forever.

            Greeted by cheering crowds, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex emerged from St. George's Chapel and kissed on the steps as the sun shone down.

            The marriage of the sixth in line to the throne to Meghan Markle, a biracial American, saw the British monarchy transform into something more representative of its people than it has been before.

            On the cobbled streets of Windsor, among the snaking river of people who turned out to celebrate, there was a sense from many that the newest member of the royal family had reinvigorated "The Firm."

            "It's good there's diversity in the royal family, it means a lot," said Abha Trivedi, a Californian who had relocated to London two weeks ago and slept overnight on a chair for a prime spot of the royal procession.

            Daljit Sidhu, of South Asian heritage but from Langley near Windsor, echoed such sentiments.

            "As Asians it's important," the 41-year-old said. "I was born and bred here, but you were always different. Ten years ago you wouldn't have thought this would happen."

            Pageantry with majesty

            Much has been spoken and written about of the newest member of royal family shaking up the establishment.

            But for all that was different about this royal wedding there was still the pomp and circumstance of old royalty.

            It was an impeccably choreographed wedding. A marching band paraded through the streets, aristocrats arrived and departed in supersized hats. Overseeing the service was the Archbishop of Canterbury.

            No one does pageantry with the majesty of the British. It comes by virtue of hundreds of years of practice.

            An estimated 100,000 had descended on this picturesque town 20 miles west of London on a glorious spring day to witness a wedding that has charmed not only the inhabitants of the UK but millions around the world.

            From Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to Ghana, the United States, Switzerland and Australia, thousands were captivated by tradition and glamor.

            They lined the cobbled streets, snacked on sandwiches drank Pimm's and waited and waited -- and waited -- for a chance to say "I was there."</td>
